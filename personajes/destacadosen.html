                    <h2>AUGUSTO CÉSAR SANDINO</h2>
                    <p>
                        Augusto Nicolás Calderón Sandino known as Augusto César Sandino was born in 1895 and died in 1934 and has been recognized over time as one of the liberators of the people of Nicaragua. He was a peasant, fighter and politician.
                        <br><br>
                        A native of Masaya, Sandino grew from hand to hand since his parents sent him to live with his grandmother, and from there to his paternal family. That forged a strong personality for him, and at 17 he sees a bloody American action. Years later he shoots a conservative and flees through different Central American countries such as Honduras or Guatemala, but it is in Mexico where he is instilled with an anti-imperialist ideology that shortly after he would develop even more.

                        <br><br>
                        In 1934, Sandino fell into a trap set by the Nicaraguan government in conjunction with the United States and was assassinated by order of Anastasio Somoza, who in turn received orders from the United States.

                    <h2>RUBÉN DARÍO</h2>
                    <p>
                        Rubén Darío, whose real name was Félix Rubén García Sarmiento, was a prestigious Nicaraguan poet, who also worked as a journalist and diplomat, was born on January 18, 1867 in Nicaragua, in the department of Matagalpa, in the city of Metapa , currently known as Ciudad Darío. His parents were Manuel García and Rosa Sarmiento.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1882 he decides to travel to El Salvador, a country presided over at that time by Rafael Zaldívar, whose secretary is the poet Joaquín Méndez Bonet, a Guatemalan national. In 1883 he returns to Nicaragua, and decides to settle in its capital, the city of Managua. In 1886 Rubén decides to travel to Chile, a country in which he stays for three years, and in which he writes in various magazines and newspapers, including "El Heraldo", "La time" or "Libertad electoral".
                        <br><br>
                        In 1892 Rubén Darío decided to move to Europe. He travels to Madrid as a member of the Nicaraguan diplomatic delegation, where he meets many politicians and prestigious writers. In 1905 he publishes "Songs of life and hope, the swans and other poems". And in 1913, in the magazine "Caras y caretas", an autobiography called "The life of Rubén Darío written by himself".
                        <br><br>
                        On February 6, 1916, Rubén Darío died in the Nicaraguan city of León, in whose cathedral he was buried. Rubén Darío is one of the 20th century poets who had the most influence on other authors, such as Juan Ramón Jiménez, Federico García Lorca, Pablo Neruda or Antonio Machado.
