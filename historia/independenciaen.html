                        It was the month of September of the year 1821. The inhabitants of the Spanish
                        province of Nicaragua, like those of the others in the region, considered that 
                        it was time for a radical Independence. The bloody independence wars in other 
                        regions of the continent and other factors led them to achieve that dream: 
                        their birth as a new and small nation, free and sovereign.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There were several factors that led the colonies to decide their separation 
                        from Spain: the emancipatory example of the British colonies in the north, 
                        the French enlightenment that brought with it new ideals, the strong control
                        and burden of taxes by the Spanish crown and the weakening progressive of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        September 15, 1821 was the date that marked an important event in the history 
                        of Central America: the signing of the Declaration of Independence of Guatemala, 
                        El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

                        On September 15 I was sitting in the Assembly, that of the Próceres, who would 
                        give us emancipation. When one of the most illustrious heroes, José Cecilio del 
                        Valle, seemed to conquer the spirits to delay the proclamation of Independence, 
                        Larreynaga and other illustrious heroes, in speeches fired with passion and reason, 
                        tipped the scales of immediate freedom, in the middle of the applause of the 
                        people that filled the galleries.

                        Ciudad Antigua, Guatemala, directing the famous conspiracy known as the 
                        "Conjura de Belén". As a consequence of Father Ruiz's involvement in the 
                        conspiracy, he was captured on the night of December 1, exactly one day before t
                        he revolutionary plan was carried out, which failed due to Pudenciano de la llana's 
                        betrayal.
